Goals for today: rest, contemplation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5 Best Skills:

1 Learner: I like the feeling of learning something. In a good day, I learn something new. 
I left the startup because I was not learning. This is my motivation in forró. 
Paired with input I like to learn deeply about everything. But time is scarce. 
Acquire info with input, process with Analytical and Intellection, discipline with achiever to 
learn as much as I can. I learn best by reading. I need to be extremely competent. 
I have to find my field by connecting everything I have learned up to this point.

2 Achiever: I like to tick off items in a checklist. In a good day, I tick off many items.

3 Intellection: Introvert, likes to think. Need time alone. Running is a good way to do that. 
Should consider going on a personal vacation now and then. 
Philosophy, literature, psichology, economics. Keep a diary with ideas. Website. 
Choose the right interlocutors. Do not debate with everyone. Write, write, write. 
Find people who like stuff you like. Hard.

4 Input: Likes to collect information, curiosity. 
Should build a system to store all this information. 
Personal website. Produce and compile information. 
Do not just collect it. Intellection is very useful to parse all this stuff.

5 Analytical: The skill I use the most in everyday life and work. 
It is very hard for me to accept a claim without overwhelming proof. 
I can be quite annoying. Should stay away from politics, economics (?).


5 Worse Skills:

30 Woo: Likes to meet strangers and win them over. I do not really like strangers. 
I have to have very good motivation to start a conversation. 
I do not want to meet thousands of people. I would rather have a few very deep friendships.

31 Communication: A weakness. Could be worse I think, but I am not a good story teller. 
Nor do I particularly like it. How to keep people engaged without this skill? 
As an analytical learner I might improve this skill by studying and talking about stories 
that contain a lesson or who work logically (?).

32 Empathy: tuned with people's emotions. I cannot really understand people's emotions. 
I tend to think they are judging me more than they actually are.

33 Adaptability: Live in the moment. No plans. Definitely one of my weaknesses. 
One way to be more adaptable is to schedule time to do nothing.

34 Developer: help people develop their potential. This is not natural to me. 
Should approach people development with other skills if ever.

Pensamento do dia:
A mente deixada livre tende ao tedio. Viver da trabalho.
Ter prazer da trabalho. O planejamento minimo garante que
eu nao desperdice a minha vida. Para que eu possa ter prioridades
e nao estar sempre sujeito aos desejos dos outros eu tenho
que perceber de forma clara o que eu desejo.


Fazer planejamento dos tres meses para:

Guitarra (importante)
Relacionamento (muito importante)
Financas (medio importante)
Calistenia
Escrita
Arte (Leitura, Desenho)
