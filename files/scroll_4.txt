# Wall painting should be two objects. A plate with the dynamic texture coordinates
# and one with the frame coordinates. They should be drawn as two different shaders.

# Renderer should allow to set render target. It should manage the framebuffers.

# The renderer should draw certain objects based on the game mode.

# The entity manager should store data about all the objects in the game.

# The renderer should acquire the objects to be drawn from the 
# entity manager according to the player position.

# All objects should have a unique id.

# The input data should be handled differently depending on the game mode and 
# the selected object(s).

# All the editors should allow a OnCloseHandler action.

# There should be objects to allow editing the current room and terrain.

# The 2D Plot should have multiple different tabs.

# An object should also have collision data to allow proper handling.

# The shaders and the static textures should only be loaded once.

# There should be undo commands in the Text Editor.

# The spreadsheet should allow editing simple tabular data.

# The building editor should allow editing the floors, by adding walls, 
# windows, doors and stairs in orthographical mode.

# The terrain editor should allow editing the terrain in orthographical mode.

# When pressing enter in front of a 2D Plot, the player should be aligned 
# to see the antialised texture.

# The engine should run in each loop: 
#   - Check game mode
#   - Acquire input
#   - Update forces
#   - Render
